# Azure2009Demos
Just savaging old code samples. This is a nostalgia for me way back in 2009, I first received SQL Azure preview inviation from Microsoft.  

I did these Azure Demos for Microsoft User Group Hyderabad as part of 48 hour non-stop tech sessions in Hyderabad Techies. 

By 2019, that makes me 10 year with Microsoft Azure Platform. I have seen all the milestones, proud to be an Azure guy.
